Huginn.jl is a package containing all the glacier ice flow models and solvers for [ODINN.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl). It also provides an accessible API to be easily used by other glacier models, such as the Open Global Glacier Model ([OGGM](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm)). This enables OGGM to access the high-performance glacier ice flow solvers in Julia in a seamless manner, via JuliaCall and PyCall.jl.
